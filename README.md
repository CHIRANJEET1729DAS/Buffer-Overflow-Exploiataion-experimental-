## Buffer Overflow Exploit Experiment: Arduino & Garuda Linux

 ## Project Overview

This repository contains two distinct but related experiments that explore buffer overflow exploits in different environments. The first project focuses on testing a buffer overflow vulnerability in an Arduino system, while the second experiment tests the same concept on a Garuda Linux system using GDB for in-depth analysis. Both projects provide valuable insights into how security mechanisms and mitigations can influence the success or failure of exploitation attempts. They offer hands-on understanding of how low-level vulnerabilities can be prevented by modern defense techniques, and how attackers can try to bypass them.

Buffer overflow vulnerabilities have been a significant security concern for decades. They are often used in remote code execution attacks, where an attacker attempts to overwrite a buffer to inject malicious code that can control the flow of execution. While buffer overflows are easier to exploit in simpler systems, modern operating systems implement several techniques to mitigate these vulnerabilities and prevent exploits, making them much harder to take advantage of.

 ## Projects Overview

**Arduino Buffer Overflow Experiment**:

1)Objective: Explore a basic buffer overflow vulnerability in an Arduino environment by manipulating the input buffer to potentially execute arbitrary code (like lighting up an LED).
2)Details: The Arduino system lacks advanced security mechanisms like ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) or stack canaries, making it a more straightforward environment for experimenting with buffer overflow exploits. However, its unique 
           memory layout and simple stack structure still offer interesting challenges and limitations for traditional exploit techniques.

## Key Learning Points:
1)Limited memory architecture on embedded systems.
2)Simpler exploitation due to lack of modern mitigations.
3)Unique challenges in embedded systems security.

## Garuda Linux Buffer Overflow Experiment:

1)Objective: Perform a buffer overflow exploit on a modern Garuda Linux system using GDB for step-by-step debugging, and identify the memory addresses required to bypass security mechanisms.
2)Details: This experiment takes place on a modern Linux system with ASLR, stack canaries, and other advanced security mechanisms enabled. These protections make exploiting buffer overflows significantly more difficult, demonstrating how modern operating systems mitigate such vulnerabilities. Despite using various techniques, the exploit failed due to these active protections, giving valuable insights into how modern systems defend against such attacks.

## Key Learning Points:
1)Impact of ASLR, stack canaries, and other protections in modern systems.
2)Step-by-step debugging using GDB to understand how exploits can be prevented.
3)Real-world challenges in bypassing modern security measures.

## Security in Modern Systems

Buffer overflows are one of the most well-known vulnerabilities that have plagued software security, but modern systems are built with robust protections to mitigate such attacks. Security mechanisms such as ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), DEP (Data Execution Prevention), stack canaries, and non-executable memory aim to defend against classic exploit techniques that rely on memory corruption.

ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization):

One of the primary defenses against buffer overflow attacks, ASLR randomizes the memory addresses used by system processes, making it harder for attackers to predict the location of specific functions or buffers. This disrupts attacks that rely on knowing the memory address of the target.

1) Stack Canaries:

A technique that involves placing a small, hidden value (the "canary") next to the return address on the stack. If the buffer overflow overwrites this value, the program detects it and halts execution, preventing the attacker from gaining control.

2) DEP (Data Execution Prevention):

This security feature ensures that certain areas of memory (like the stack or heap) cannot be executed. This makes it more difficult for attackers to inject malicious code into these regions of memory.
In the Garuda Linux experiment, these protections were enabled by default, demonstrating how they can effectively prevent the exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities. On the other hand, the Arduino experiment had no such protections, providing a simpler environment to explore the underlying mechanics of buffer overflows.


**In both cases, the experiments highlight the importance of security mechanisms in preventing low-level vulnerabilities. Understanding how these defenses work is crucial for anyone working in cybersecurity or embedded systems development, as it shows the ongoing battle between attackers trying to exploit weaknesses and developers building defenses to protect systems.**

This repository is an excellent starting point for anyone looking to understand buffer overflow vulnerabilities, security mitigations, and how modern systems are designed to handle low-level exploits.
